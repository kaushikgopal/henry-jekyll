Henry is a [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/) theme with a gorgeous reading experience, chock-full of features. To find out more about all the features check out this [blog post](https://jkl.gg/b/henry-jekyll-theme/).

# Getting Started

The easiest way to get up and running with a Jekyll blog using Henry is using the included [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) configuration file.

```shell
# 1. clone Henry
git clone git@github.com:kaushikgopal/henry-jekyll.git my_blog
# 2. cleanup script so unnecessary files are remoed
./start_new_blog.sh
# 3. spin up blog with docker
docker-compose up
```

You're good to go!

```shell
## on a Mac
http://0.0.0.0:4000/
## on Windows
http://localhost:4000/
```

You can setup new/existing blogs with Henry, with or without Docker. Feel free to refer to this [setup guide](./setup.md) for details.

## Github Pages
